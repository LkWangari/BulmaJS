# 0.5.0
+ [#38](https://github.com/VizuaaLOG/BulmaJS/pull/38) Adjust how plugins are initialised by using classes instead. Data attributes can still be used for customising the plugins behaviour, if supported. (closes [#20](https://github.com/VizuaaLOG/BulmaJS/issues/20))
+ [43b64cd](https://github.com/VizuaaLOG/BulmaJS/commit/43b64cdea58fe6b512ce95c69172889d75b68179) Add a new option to the tabs plugin that allows tabs to be changed when the user hovers over the tab link. On mobile this will revert back to the click/tap handler due to the lack of a hover event being called. (closes [#35](https://github.com/VizuaaLOG/BulmaJS/issues/35))
