Bulma provides a nice button dropdown component. By default this component needs Javascript to show/hide the dropdown when the button is clicked/tapped. You can add the `is-hover` class to show/hide the dropdown when the user places there mouse over the button.

However, when you would like to use the clicking functionality BulmaJS can be used to add the required Javascript dust!
